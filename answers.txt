Q: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A: A merge takes two separate branches and combines them into one. Any changes in either branch are combined into both after the merge. Rebase is similar but instead of combining the two, you are essentially taking what you want to rebase and adding it in line with the existing stuff.
